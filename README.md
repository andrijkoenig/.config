# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

I manage syncing and updating them using a **simple Java tool** I wrote called [`DotfileSync`](./DotfileSync.java).

- Copy files from the repo to your system: `write`
- Sync changes from your system back to the repo: `sync`

See [`DotfileSync.java`](./DotfileSync.java) for details on configuration and usage.
